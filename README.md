3 - One task should be done by one or more robots <br/>
4 - Each task can only be completed once <br/>

6 - Possibility to force a robot to complete a task <br/>
7 - Possibility to restrict a robot from completing a task <br/>
8 - Constraint for navigation type (route-based) <br/>
9 - Tasks may need more than one robot to be executed <br/>
10 - Distance between tasks can be calculated via position or direct input <br/>
